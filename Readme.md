Codesmelt
=========

A web based HTML, CSS, & Javascript editor with live rendering.

Project Plans
-------------
* Clean up interface
* Clean up code base, refactor a lot of files
* Look into better implementations for file upload/download
* Expand upon everything
* Keep it simple
* Implement support for other languages
* Work on better render functions
* Want support for Markdown (shouldn't be too hard right?)
* Finishing this readme

Project Dependencies
--------------------
* CodeMirror2 - crutches heavily on this, I hope that I will be able to give back
to this project some day.

* jQuery - running 90% of everything, keeps a lot of the Javascript nice and clean
while writing

* PHP - used for 2 functions: file upload and download. Want to try breaking from
this requirement so it can be standalone without a PHP service running.

Project History

### Original Project Specification

>“HTML, Javascript, SVG Editor”
>
>Build an editing environment running in the browser which allows people to create markup, preview it as working HTML or SVG with script, and edit and save their work. It should be syntax-aware so that markup and possibly script is prechecked and highlighted for correctness 

Codesmelt was the result of a final coursework project of mine during my senior year of college. After the presentation was over, I had managed to get the other students in my group to let this be open sourced instead of die afterward. 

I loved working on this project and feel that it has tons of potential since I'm no longer restricted to what libraries may be utilized.
